# PIPELINE LEAK DETECTION USING EDGE DATA ANALYTICS

The Pipeline leakage Detection â€“ Demand increases as population increases  Efficient water management is also being expanded to minimize effort and cost. 
One of the biggest challenges in this regard is water leakage in the water distribution network,Leads to water loss of approximately 30-40 percentage of available drinking water.
As a solution for this scenerio A cost effective leak detection technique using Edge Data Analytics is introduced.
